# Gamry
EPICS-testing support for Gamry potentiostat devices

This support module only shows the first steps how to communicate with the Gamry Electrochemical Toolkit. It is not a complete driver and further development is not planed. The Gamry Instruments Framework is very extensive. However it offers the possibility to be triggered via a multi-purpose user I/O cable.
